                                        <b>Marseille Basil</b> and <b>Italian Basil</b>, we have a delicious <b>Thai Basil</b>, which is used in
                                         Asian cuisine to provide a spicy flavor similar to that of tarragon or anise. We also

                                         used in Mediterranean cuisine to provide a fresh lemony tarragon flavor. Finally, we also 
                                         have a superb <b>Cinnamon Basil</b>, originating from South America and providing a touch of originality 
                                         with its "sweet-savory" flavor, not forgetting the wonderful <b>Purple Basil</b>, which has the same taste
                                          as Green Basil but with very decorative foliage.

                                  silvery-gray color that shines almost like crystals in the sun. Its salty taste and crunchy 
                                  texture make this a refreshing plant ideal for adding to salads in summer. This plant can also be
                                   cooked, just like spinach, to be served with fish or shellfish.

                                <p align="justify">Kale is a curly cabbage from the Brassicaceae family. In France, it was used in the Middle Ages and
                                      is actually one of the oldest cabbages in Europe! However, it disappeared for several years before 
                                      experiencing a revival due to its nutritional benefits. Who hasn't heard about the famous "The Kale
                                       Project", created by Kristen Beddard to re-acquaint people with this wonderful forgotten vegetable?
                                        Given the nutrient profile of Kale (iron, fiber, vitamins A, C and K, calcium, potassium, etc.), it
                                         could be considered a real anti-aging, anti-cholesterol and antioxidant hit. <br>
                                        As an ingredient, Kale can be enjoyed raw or cooked, in soups, sauces, stir-fried, 
                                        as chips, steamed…it's impossible to get bored of it!

                                <p align="justify">Amaranth, also known as Chinese Spinach, belongs to the Amaranthaceae family. Grown mainly 
                                     in south-west Asia, Amaranth is largely unknown in Europe for its foliage, and yet its young
                                      shoots have many health benefits. <br>
                                      Eaten raw in salads, its leaves are sweet and crunchy, and give a beautiful 
                                      touch of color to your dish. Amaranth can also be cooked. For example, its leaves 
                                      are delicious sautéed in garlic. Be careful not to overcook it, otherwise it will 
                                      lose its crunchiness. Served on a bed of rice, it gives the rice a lovely pink tint.

                                <p align="justify">Red-Veined Dock is an aromatic herb from the Polygonaceae family. 
                                      A very decorative ingredient, it can be used in salads or cooked like spinach.
                                       Its leaves are thinner and its taste tangier than <b>Green Dock</b>. <br>
                                       Red-Veined Dock is known for its high carotene content (antioxidant) but it is also 
                                       one of the best vegetables in terms of its high content of vitamin C, vitamin A and iron.
                                        No wonder then that it was widely consumed by the Egyptians, the Greeks and then by the Romans!

                                <p align="justify">Belonging to the Brassicaceae family, mustard plants can be grown for their seeds. For example, 
                                 brown mustard seeds are used to make Dijon mustard. However, we mainly harvest their beautiful 
                                 brown leaves and stems. <br>
                                It is said that mustard was widely consumed in the Middle Ages as an accompaniment for meat, 
                                sometimes to hide the rotten taste! In terms of its composition, this plant has a high 
                                concentration of vitamin C, which gives it anti-fatigue properties, meaning that 
                                regular consumption can strengthen the immune system. <br>Mustard leaves can be eaten raw in 
                                salad (watch out: it stings!) or cooked like spinach to accompany fish, game or poultry. 
                                We recommend that you add a pinch of sugar to your dishes to sweeten the acidity of the mustard.

                                    as mint, this plant adapts very well to the European climate. Varieties include Green Shiso,
                                     Purple Shiso, but, also, a rarer two-colored, green and purple Shiso. This plant is decorative,
                                      aromatic and medicinal all at the same time. It can be eaten in salads, cooked with rice or pasta,
                                       tempura-fried, used in juices, oils, or herbal teas, in powder or sprout form, even Shiso buds can
                                        be eaten! This plant is definitely worth a try.

                                <p align="justify">Winter Purslane, also known as "chicken plant", is a plant from the 
                                    Portulacaceae family. Its leaves look like those of Lamb's Lettuce. It can be used in 
                                    salads or cooked in soups. It has a slightly tangy and peppery taste, and its leaves
                                     are bursting with sap. It is often cooked like spinach but, whatever the method of 
                                     cooking, it must be cooked for a very short time so that the Purslane remains crunchy
                                      and doesn't lose its nutritional properties. Winter Purslane is the basis of the 
                                      "Cretan/Mediterranean diet" because of its health benefits: it would be perfect for 
                                      lowering cholesterol. During the reign of Louis XIV in France, his gardener recommended
                                       Purslane to the king because of its various benefits.

                                      Christmas Bell or Peri Peri. Originating from South America, it is thought that it was brought
                                       back from Brazil by the Portuguese in the 18th century. In addition to its very decorative 
                                       appearance, this pepper is distinguishable by its very mild, sweet taste. <br>
                                       It can be eaten green or red, but we recommend that you remove the seeds before eating it.
                                        We have tried several recipes and our favorites are fried peppers served with coarse salt
                                         (like in Galicia, Spain), feta-stuffed peppers baked in the oven, or green chili jam. When 
                                         it is dried, this pepper can also be powdered and preserved.

                                       purées and on roast potatoes. <br>The so-called watercress sauce is made from watercress,
                                        mixed with hard-boiled eggs, vinegar and oil. <br>As with all members of the Brassicaceae
